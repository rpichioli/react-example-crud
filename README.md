### Summary
The main idea of this project is to create an application which works with relational database though NodeJS API services exploring React features and possibilities.

We are building a simple login/logout feature by a HOC (High Order Component) in React-side that calls an authorization middleware in the API backend, as a layer, that authorizes the user to access all the stuff if everything is OK.

> - The **client-side** is a React + Redux app based.
> - The **server-side** is built in NodeJS (Express) and works like an API server.
> - This application uses Sequelize ORM to manage relational database and maintain it's data.
> - The [Passport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport) is basically a Express-compatible authentication middleware for Node.js.

No use of Flow in this application, only prop-types for data typing in components.

If you have some suggestion, please let me know about it!

#### Server-Side
Located in the "/server/" folder, here becomes the NodeJS Express application.
Use ```npm install``` to install all dependencies and ```npm start``` to run the app.

#### Client-Side
Located in the "/client/" folder, here is the React app. Built with the package "create-react-app" and working with Redux.
Use ```npm install``` to install all dependencies and ```npm start``` to run the app.
